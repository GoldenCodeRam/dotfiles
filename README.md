# Custom configs

Here are some of the custom configurations I like to use.

## Themes

I've followed the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme
and configs for a while and I like it in general, so this is what I
will use for now.

As most of the packages use GTK3 and some other configurations for i3wm,
we need the `lxappearance` package.

 - [Catppuccin GTK Theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk).
 - [Catppuccin Cursors](https://github.com/catppuccin/cursors).

## Screenshots

For now, I don't have a good understanding of how to do this, but I have
found a [gist](https://gist.github.com/dianjuar/ee774561a8bc02b077989bc17424a19f)
containing a pretty good solution for now. You will need the following packages:

 - maim
 - xclip
 - xdotool
