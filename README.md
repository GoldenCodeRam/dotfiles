# Custom configs

Here are some of the custom configurations I like to use.

## Themes

I've followed the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) theme
and configs for a while and I like it in general, so this is what I
will use for now.

As most of the packages use GTK3 and some other configurations for i3wm,
we need the `lxappearance` package.
